#Next Steps

## Keep Ratio

Currently keep ration axisNORTH allows the northern handle to be used to stretch
the figure in both north and south directions. I'd like to be able to stretch
just north, or to lock north and south, or to lock north and east, or to lock
all four directions.

## Abstraction

As it stands we are in much the same situation as before: we are allowed a fixed
number of handles in fixed positions. I think it would be totally cool to have the
distance, size, and position of the handles be arbitrary, as well as the number of
handles.

## Icons

The handles can currently have fill colour and size set on them, but I want to be
able to specify icons to be used. Not sure whether we would use favicons, arbitrary
URLs, or a small set of icons...

## Event Listening

The handles should be easily accessible for attaching event listeners.
